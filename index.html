          <h2>Mathematics Student</h2>

          <p>As a Mathematics student, I have spent years practicing creative, problem-solving skills. During my time in school, I have gained research experience, worked for and with professors, and taken classes on computer science and promming languages.</p>
          <p>I am working on courses to learn web development in my spare time, and hope to break into a field where I can challenge my creative problem-solving skills.</p>
